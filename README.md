A fork of Mozilla's [Firefox Send][mozilla-send].
Mozilla discontinued Send, this fork is a community effort to keep the project
up-to-date and alive.

- Forked [at][fork-commit] Mozilla's last publicly hosted version
- _Mozilla_ & _Firefox_ branding [is][remove-branding-pr] removed so you can legally self-host
- Kept compatible with [`ffsend`][ffsend] (CLI for Send)
- Dependencies have been updated
- Mozilla's [changes][mozilla-patches] since the fork have been selectively [merged][mozilla-patches-pr]
- Mozilla's experimental report feature, download tokens, trust warnings and FxA changes are not included

Find an up-to-date Docker image here: [docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md)

The original project by Mozilla can be found [here][mozilla-send].
The [`mozilla-master`][branch-mozilla-master] branch holds the `master` branch
as left by Mozilla.
The [`send-v3`][branch-send-v3] branch holds the commit tree of Mozilla's last
publicly hosted version, which this fork is based on.
The [`send-v4`][branch-send-v4] branch holds the commit tree of Mozilla's last
experimental version which was still a work in progress (featuring file
reporting, download tokens, trust warnings and FxA changes), this has
selectively been merged into this fork.
Please consider to [donate][donate] to allow me to keep working on this.

Thanks [Mozilla][mozilla] for building this amazing tool!
